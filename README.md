# GitHub_Actions

# There are many challenges that DevOps engineers face when dealing with Jenkins as the main CI/CD tool for the company. 

# Some of these issues include:

# Securuity of the plugins - not able to track who is patching the main plugins and whether the required protocols are being followed. 

# Incompatibility of the plugins 

# Frequent update of the plugins 

# As a result, there is a need to explore other CI/CD tools like GITOPS abd GITHUB ACTIONS. 

# Both tools runs only primary plugins - You do not have to worry about dependencies and incompatbility issues 

# All major/primary plugins have their own docker container, making them easy to manage. 

# In this sessiion, we are going to focus entirely on GitHub Actions
